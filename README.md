# Connect-Four-Game

Connect Four is a classic two-player connection game in which players choose a color and take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a vertically suspended grid. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

<b>Game Rules:</b>  
The grid is 6 rows by 7 columns, named from A to G.  
Players take turns to drop one colored disc into the grid on their chosen column.  
The disc falls down to the lowest empty slot in the chosen column.  
The game continues until one player achieves a line of four discs of their color, or the grid is filled with no winner.  
<b> Implementation Details:</b>  
This implementation provides a basic command-line version of the game written in Java.  
It features a 6x7 grid for gameplay and supports two players, one taking the role of Red and the other Yellow.  
Players input their moves by specifying the column letter where they want to drop their disc.
